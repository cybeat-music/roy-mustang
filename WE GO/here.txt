Let me romanize this anime theme song release:

[2025.02.03] TV Anime "SPECIAL EDITED VERSION 'ONE PIECE' Gyojin-tou hen" OP3 Theme "We Go! ~Shirakami Fubuki, Houshou Marine, Tsunomaki Watame with Otsuki Maki ver.~" [FLAC]

This appears to be a cover version of "We Go!" (ONE PIECE opening) performed by hololive VTubers Shirakami Fubuki, Houshou Marine, and Tsunomaki Watame, featuring Otsuki Maki. It's used as the third opening theme for the special edited version of the Fishman Island arc. Would you like any other information about this release while being mindful of copyright?
